 A Sudoku solver using the backtracking algorithm. It includes a graphical GUI as well as a text based version.
 ## Requirements
 1. Download and install Python3 [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
 2. I recommend using [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted). Download Pygame by opening a terminal and typing:
    ```bash
    pip install pygame
    ```
# Instructions
Run GUI.py to play sudoku.
Click a box and hit the number on your keybaord to pencil in a number. To confirm that value press the ENTER key on that box. To delete a pencil in you can click DEL. Finally to solve the board press SPACE, sit back and watch the algorithm run.
